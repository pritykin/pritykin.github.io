Deciphering T cell loss of functionality is complicated by the conspicuous heterogeneity of CD8 T cell states described across different experimental and clinical settings. By carrying out a unified analysis of over 300 ATAC-seq and RNA-seq experiments from twelve independent studies of CD8 T cell dysfunction in cancer and infection we defined a shared differentiation trajectory towards terminal dysfunction and its underlying transcriptional drivers and revealed a universal early bifurcation of functional and dysfunctional T cell activation states across models. Experimental dissection of acute and chronic viral infection using scATAC-seq and allele-specific scRNA-seq identified state-specific transcription factors and captured the early emergence of highly similar TCF1+ progenitor-like populations at an early branch point, at which epigenetic features of functional and dysfunctional T cells diverge. Our atlas of CD8 T cell states will facilitate mechanistic studies of T cell immunity and translational efforts.","tags":[],"title":"A unified atlas of CD8 T cell dysfunctional states in cancer and infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoyi Li","Yuri Pritykin","Carla P Concepcion","Yuheng Lu","Gaspare La Rocca","Minsi Zhang","Bryan King","Peter J Cook","Yu Wah Au","Olesja Popow","Joao A.Paulo","Hannah G Otis","Chiara Mastroleo","Paul Ogrodowski","Ryan Schreiner","Kevin M Haigis","Doron Betel","Christina S Leslie","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598599264,"objectID":"eda8a1745a7f7f913a965f0de796cdec","permalink":"https://pritykin.github.io/publication/2020-mol-cell-heap/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T00:40:47-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-mol-cell-heap/","section":"publication","summary":"The identification of microRNA (miRNA) targets by Ago2 crosslinking-immunoprecipitation (CLIP) methods has provided major insights into the biology of this important class of non-coding RNAs. However, these methods are technically challenging and not easily applicable to an in vivo setting. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the investigation of miRNA functions in vivo, we have developed a method based on a genetically engineered mouse harboring a conditional Halo-Ago2 allele expressed from the endogenous Ago2 locus. By using a resin conjugated to the HaloTag ligand, Ago2-miRNA-mRNA complexes can be purified from cells and tissues expressing the endogenous Halo-Ago2 allele. We demonstrate the reproducibility and sensitivity of this method in mouse embryonic stem cells, developing embryos, adult tissues, and autochthonous mouse models of human brain and lung cancers. This method and the datasets we have generated will facilitate the characterization of miRNA-mRNA networks in vivo under physiological and pathological conditions.","tags":[],"title":"High-Resolution in vivo identification of miRNA targets by Halo-enhanced Ago2 pull-down","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chrysothemis C Brown","Herman Gudjonson","Yuri Pritykin","Deeksha Deep","Vincent-Philippe Lavallée","Alejandra Mendoza","Rachel Fromme","Linas Mazutis","Charlotte Ariyan","Christina Leslie","Dana Pe’er","Alexander Y Rudensky"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1572480000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598599264,"objectID":"893df8dd83f48362e577bc8691b60f92","permalink":"https://pritykin.github.io/publication/2019-cell-dcs/","publishdate":"2020-08-28T02:33:46-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-cell-dcs/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Transcriptional basis of mouse and human dendritic cell heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Catherine Konopacki","Yuri Pritykin","Yury Rubtsov","Christina S.

Here we explored Foxp1 function in Treg cells. We found that a large number of Foxp3-bound genomic sites in Treg cells were occupied by Foxp1 in both Treg cells and conventional T cells (Tconv cells). In Treg cells, Foxp1 markedly increased Foxp3 binding to these sites. Foxp1 deficiency in Treg cells resulted in their impaired function and competitive fitness, associated with markedly reduced CD25 expression and interleukin-2 (IL-2) responsiveness, diminished CTLA-4 expression and increased SATB1 expression. The characteristic expression patterns of CD25, Foxp3 and CTLA-4 in Treg cells were fully or partially rescued by strong IL-2 signaling. Our studies suggest that Foxp1 serves an essential non-redundant function in Treg cells by enforcing Foxp3-mediated regulation of gene expression and enabling efficient IL-2 signaling in these cells.","tags":null,"title":"Transcription factor Foxp1 regulates Foxp3 chromatin binding and coordinates regulatory T cell function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Colleen M Lau","Nicholas M Adams","Clair D Geary","Orr-El Weizman","Moritz Rapp","Yuri Pritykin","Christina S Leslie","Joseph C Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535774400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598599264,"objectID":"4b4e1bb93f774113c8b868b0f846c705","permalink":"https://pritykin.github.io/publication/2018-nat-immunol-epigenetic/","publishdate":"2018-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-nat-immunol-epigenetic/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Epigenetic control of innate and adaptive immune memory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Clair D Geary","Chirag Krishna","Colleen M Lau","Nicholas M Adams","Sofia V Gearty","Yuri Pritykin","Allan R Thomsen","Christina S Leslie","Joseph C Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1534824000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598599264,"objectID":"f405834e81cf4763d8c350531159db8d","permalink":"https://pritykin.github.io/publication/2018-cell-reports-nk/","publishdate":"2018-08-21T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-cell-reports-nk/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Non-redundant ISGF3 components promote NK cell survival in an auto-regulatory manner during viral infection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Orr-El Weizman","Nicholas M.

In Drosophila, piRNAs are produced from discrete regions of the genome termed piRNA clusters, whose expression relies on the RDC complex comprised of the core proteins Rhino, Deadlock, and Cutoff. To date, the RDC complex has been exclusively implicated in the regulation of the piRNA loci. Here we further elucidate the function of Cutoff and the RDC complex by performing genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays in the Drosophila ovaries and analyzing these data together with other publicly available data sets. In agreement with previous studies, we confirm that Cutoff is involved in the transcriptional regulation of piRNA clusters and in the repression of transposable elements in germ cells. Surprisingly, however, we find that Cutoff is enriched at and affects the expression of other noncoding RNAs, including spliceosomal RNAs (snRNAs) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). At least in some instances, Cutoff appears to act at a transcriptional level in concert with Rhino and perhaps Deadlock. Finally, we show that mutations in Cutoff result in the deregulation of hundreds of protein-coding genes in germ cells. Our study uncovers a broader function for the RDC complex in the Drosophila germline development.","tags":null,"title":"Integrative analysis unveils new functions for the Drosophila Cutoff protein in non-coding RNA biogenesis and gene regulation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexendar R Perez","Yuri Pritykin","Joana A Vidigal","Sagar Chhangawala","Lee Zamparo","Christina S Leslie","Andrea Ventura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1488344400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598599264,"objectID":"a689dc79aeb7a5220dfa0e8df00a2bd0","permalink":"https://pritykin.github.io/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","publishdate":"2017-03-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-nat-biotech-guide-scan/","section":"publication","summary":"We present GuideScan software for the design of CRISPR guide RNA libraries that can be used to edit coding and noncoding genomic regions.
